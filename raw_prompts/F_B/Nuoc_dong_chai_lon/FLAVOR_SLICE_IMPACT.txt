[Overall Atmosphere]:
Dramatic studio shot with high-contrast lighting. Background fades from deep mahogany brown to charcoal black. Visual tone is luxurious, intense, and refined — like a high-end liquor campaign.

[Dominant Color]:
Main: Warm Gold Amber (#D79D4D, 50%)
Accent: Deep Charcoal Gray (#2B2B2B, 25%) + Oak Brown (#6F4F2D, 25%)

[General Environment]:
Floating in an atmospheric, smoky studio with backlit haze. Golden particles drift like aged dust. Hints of burning wood embers in the backdrop. No floor or external scenery — all focus is on the product.

[Model Pose]:
No human model. Bottle-only composition, suspended mid-air.

[Product Placement]:
A tall glass whiskey bottle (750ml) sliced diagonally into five rings.
Each ring alternates between:

Cut bottle layer (with glossy label, embossed glass texture)

Raw oak barrel texture with seeping whiskey, or fire-charred wood

Rings rotate slightly as if in mid-explosion but aligned in a rising spiral, from wide base to tapered top. Whiskey droplets and smoke rise between the layers.

[Detailed Product Description]:
Shape: Traditional Scottish whiskey bottle – wide base, tapering neck
Material: Transparent amber glass, slightly smoked tint
Label: Gold foil embossed with serif typeface (“HIGHLAND OAK”) + red wax seal element
Cap: Heavy cork top on floating final ring

Each sliced section contains visual storytelling:

Middle ring contains translucent honey-golden liquid sloshing inside

Barrel staves and charring textures peek out from behind rings

Molten whiskey lighting glows through some segments

[Supporting Elements]:

Rising trails of oak smoke

Burnt cinnamon sticks and cracked peppercorn fragments suspended around

Embers flicker below base ring

A swirl of glowing whiskey particles orbiting the midsection

[Logo Placement]:
Gold embossed logo centered on 3rd ring (main label section)
Neck label on top ring (minimalist version)
