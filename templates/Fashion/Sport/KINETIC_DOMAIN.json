  "prompt_base": "Suspended test chamber — gravity partially disabled. Particles float in air like frozen sparks. Motion-capture lasers slice through frame diagonally. Feels like time is between seconds. Void platform, mid-air. Model floats just above surface. Holographic terrain grid flickering beneath. Backdrop is pulsating black field with triangulated echo waves. Post-human android (non-gendered, translucent skin) in sprint pose, left foot bent forward, spine curved, arm mid-drive. Eyes emit slow glow. Muscle layers semi-transparent, visible under outfit. 1 hero item: kinetic active-core suit 2 supporting: external pulse leggings + forearm booster wraps Each item annotated with micro data-point overlay (zoomed) • Holographic arrows display energy flow from calf to shoulder • Inset scan of fiber tension matrix (right shoulder) • Foot pressure UI rings on ground • Heart rate waveform curves behind model • Floating panel reads: “Strain Index 87% – Calibrating…” Shape: Aerodynamic compression mapped to muscle direction Material: Reactive synth-weave + kinetic graphene bands Key Feature: Dual-core motion capacitor embedded in chest zone",
