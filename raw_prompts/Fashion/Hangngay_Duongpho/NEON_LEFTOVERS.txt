[Overall Atmosphere]
Nighttime urban isolation. Mix of harsh flash + neon spill (4:1), background shadows deep and crushed. Feels like caught in transit.

[General Environment]
Alleyway behind convenience store — reflective puddles, brick wall with graffiti, fluorescent light from broken signboard flickering. Motorbike parked halfway out of frame.

[Model Pose]
Androgynous model (Korean-German, short buzzcut), sitting on upturned crate, staring deadpan at camera. One leg extended, jacket off-shoulder. Flash catches face sharply.

[Product Placement]
1 hero item (black technical bomber jacket with reflective lining)
2 supporting pieces (cropped ribbed top + cargo mini skirt) — edgy layering, high-contrast fit

No natural light, no smiling, no cozy outfit, no greenery, no golden hour tones, no warm ambiance, no minimalism.
