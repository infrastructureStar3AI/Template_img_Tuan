[Overall Atmosphere]
Anti-timefold field.
Light bends unnaturally around product, casting both forward and backward shadows.
Background pulses slowly — like breathing fabric made of stars.

[Dominant Color]
Main: Gravity Black (#1C1C1C, 60%)
Accent: Vortex Amethyst (#9966CC, 25%)

[General Environment]
Infinite staircase loops upon itself mid-air, Escher-style.
The ring rests on a single hovering marble tile — which spins gently in place without support.
Purple light leaks from invisible seams in space.

[Model Pose]
None. The product is central, floating.
However, a marble hand reaches out from a fold in reality, trying to grasp it — frozen mid-motion.

[Product Placement]
1 hero item: Amethyst-cut ring in twisted silver band

Shadow ring echo appears behind, delayed by 0.5s

[Detailed Product Description]
Shape: Spiral double-band with pronged gemstone mount
Material: Rhodium-plated silver + precision-cut amethyst (oval 1.4ct)
Key Feature: Asymmetrical tension setting — stone appears suspended in magnetic pressure

[Supporting Elements]
• Soft echo blur behind gemstone
• Grid fracture under ring’s floating tile
• Small tag reads “<TIME: FOLDED>” engraved on edge
• Reflected silhouette shows a different version of the ring (glitch artifact)

[Logo Placement]
Hidden under floating tile, only visible via ring’s gemstone reflection
Secondary logo: glitch-printed onto staircase edge (faint)

[Ad Elements]
Main Text: "TIME TWISTS, YOU STAY RARE." (font: EB Garamond Semi-Italic, 30pt, Vortex Amethyst)
CTA: "Unravel the fold →" (QR code, braided into marble hand’s wrist)
Logo: Stamped behind time tear on top-left
Badge: "RING_08 // PARADOX LINE" — distorted emboss in lower-right glitch

[Image Type]
Hyperreal render, f/2.2, extreme depth warp.
Vignette bounces between violet and black.
Edges of the image slightly loop into each other like a closed GIF.

[Negative Prompt]
No linear lighting, no common background, no realism, no earthly location, no smiling people, no grounded physics.
