  "prompt_base": "Hyper-still surrealism, confection frozen in time under a 6:1 lighting ratio; cold museum lighting casting crystal refractions, atmosphere of sacred preservation. Abstract patisserie relic room — fractured marble plinths, shards of frosted glass on floor, matte velvet backdrop with gentle folds, a suspended spoon casting soft diffraction. None. No human presence. The cake becomes the sole protagonist — elevated like an archaeological discovery or luxury gem. 1 hero item (multi-faceted crystal cake resembling a strawberry shortcake with translucent jelly-like layers)  2 supporting pieces (a halved mini tart with gem-like strawberry glaze, and a floating sugar shard) — arranged in an isosceles triangle of scattered light rays. Cracked porcelain dessert plate with golden rim, ghostlike silver fork hovering at 10°, trail of powdered sugar falling mid-air, stylized menu plaque with serif type etched in glass. Shape: Dome-shaped layered cake with beveled geometry and refractive sugar crust.   Material: Simulated crystalized fondant, edible jelly interior.   Key Feature: Embedded candied strawberry slices suspended mid-layer like frozen time bubbles.",
  "negative_prompt": "No cartoon frosting, no human hand, no traditional pastry kitchen, no rustic style, no wooden surfaces, no pastel overuse, no blur, no food crumbs.",
