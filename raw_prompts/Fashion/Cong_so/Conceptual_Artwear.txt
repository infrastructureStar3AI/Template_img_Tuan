[General Environment]: Abstract office ruin — a deconstructed cubicle built from concrete slabs, scattered fluorescent light tubes on the floor, suspended ceiling panel floating mid-air.

[Model Pose]: Androgynous Vietnamese model in her 30s, standing on one leg atop a broken desk, spine arched backwards unnaturally, tie draped over face, briefcase hanging from elbow, eyes closed.

[Product Placement]:
1 hero item (deconstructed gray power suit jacket with asymmetric hem)

2 supporting pieces (crumpled red silk tie, pinstripe trousers with raw edge) — arranged in reverse-pyramid composition.

[Detailed Product Description]:
Shape: One-shouldered tailored blazer with exploded inner structure.
Material: Stiff wool suiting fabric fused with resin panels.
Key Feature: Fold-out lapel resembling architectural wings.

[Supporting Elements]: Upside-down office chair bolted to wall, wall clock with melted face à la Dalí, floating copier paper caught in motion at 1/1000s.
