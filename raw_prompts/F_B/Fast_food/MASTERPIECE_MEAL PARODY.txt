[Overall Atmosphere]: humorous parody of the painting "American Gothic", midwestern farmhouse tone combined with absurd fast food elements, warm muted daylight with slight desaturation

[Dominant Color]: faded denim blue, muted beige, dark brown wood, with visual contrast from fast food colors — ketchup red, cheese yellow, soda black

[General Environment]: rural American farmhouse setting faithfully recreated in background — wooden house with gothic window, grey cloudy sky, wooden fence partially visible

[Model Pose]: same pose as original painting — a stern-faced man in overalls holding a pitchfork, standing beside a woman in dark apron dress — but now they both hold fast food items in deadpan seriousness

[Product Placement]:  
- The man holds a **giant cheeseburger impaled on the pitchfork**, centered and straight, oozing with melted cheese and sauce  
- The woman clutches a **branded fast food paper bag** with both hands at her waist level — the top of a fries box and a drink cup poking out

[Detailed Product Description]:  
- **Burger**: triple-stack beef burger with melted cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and ketchup visibly dripping from the sides, sesame bun slightly uneven, a bite taken from the top layer  
- **Fries**: sticking out of red paper box, some tilted, textures clearly defined with crisp ends  
- **Drink**: translucent plastic soda cup with branded logo, a tilted red straw and condensation droplets on surface  
- **Paper Bag**: wrinkled kraft paper texture with oil spots, printed logo and slogan on front

[Supporting Elements]:  
- Man’s denim overalls have subtle **sauce splatter stains**  
- Woman’s collar now subtly patterned with **mini burgers and fries icons**  
- A small ketchup packet lies on the ground near their feet  
- Background house has a neon fast food **"Drive-Thru"** sign hanging under the gothic window

[Logo Placement]:  
- Brand logo printed clearly on both the paper bag and soda cup  
- Subtly incorporated on the burger wrapping sticking out from pitchfork

[Ad Elements]:  
- A museum-style wall label reads:  
  **“American Fast Food – From Grant Wood to Grand Combo – 129k”**  
- Optional header text overlay in painting corner:  
  **“Tradition Meets Taste”** in old-style serif font  
- Tagline along the bottom edge:  
  **“Now serving culture since 1930.”**

[Image Type]:  
- Digital parody illustration of a classic American painting  
- Maintains oil painting brush texture, slightly aged tone, soft light falloff  
- Characters' expressions remain serious and stoic, enhancing ironic contrast

[Negative Prompt]:  
- No modern background, no photographic realism, no cartoon exaggeration, no pop art style, no anime or chibi rendering, no flat lay food styling
