[Overall Atmosphere]:
Zen-inspired studio visual. Central vertical bottle floats slightly above a soft glowing floor. Eye-level perspective. Inside the bottle is a serene miniature floating garden — a shallow pond with lily pads, spiraling cucumber vines, and a single blooming jasmine tree that bends gently inwards. Mist swirls lightly around the base. The whole scene feels weightless, calming, and purified.
