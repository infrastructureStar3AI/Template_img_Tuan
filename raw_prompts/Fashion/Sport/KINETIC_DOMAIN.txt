[Overall Atmosphere]
Suspended test chamber — gravity partially disabled. Particles float in air like frozen sparks. Motion-capture lasers slice through frame diagonally. Feels like time is between seconds.

[Dominant Color]
Main: Matte Graphite (#2E2E2E, 70%)
Accent: Pulse Red (#FF3E3E, 20%)

[General Environment]
Void platform, mid-air. Model floats just above surface. Holographic terrain grid flickering beneath. Backdrop is pulsating black field with triangulated echo waves.

[Model Pose]
Post-human android (non-gendered, translucent skin) in sprint pose, left foot bent forward, spine curved, arm mid-drive. Eyes emit slow glow. Muscle layers semi-transparent, visible under outfit.

[Product Placement]
1 hero item: kinetic active-core suit
2 supporting: external pulse leggings + forearm booster wraps
Each item annotated with micro data-point overlay (zoomed)

[Detailed Product Description]
Shape: Aerodynamic compression mapped to muscle direction
Material: Reactive synth-weave + kinetic graphene bands
Key Feature: Dual-core motion capacitor embedded in chest zone

[Supporting Elements]
• Holographic arrows display energy flow from calf to shoulder
• Inset scan of fiber tension matrix (right shoulder)
• Foot pressure UI rings on ground
• Heart rate waveform curves behind model
• Floating panel reads: “Strain Index 87% – Calibrating…”

[Logo Placement]

Etched on motion capacitor center (front chest)

Glitch-printed barcode running vertically on spine panel

[Ad Elements]
Main Text: "CALIBRATE YOUR CORE" (font: Orbitron Bold, pulse red)
CTA: "Download motion protocol →" (embedded QR capsule, top-right HUD)
Logo: Rotating holo-icon floating near model
Badge: "V3_α MOTION SUIT" (white stamp under foot plane)

[Image Type]
Rendered in Unreal Engine-style 3D. Volumetric light. Depth blur on grid. Reflections are procedurally distorted. Clarity: 8K, slight static noise. Camera f/1.8, ISO simulated: 320.

[Negative Prompt]
No real-world gym, no soft fabric, no smiles, no nature, no retro, no normal humans, no realism.
