  "prompt_base": "Absurdist stillness, controlled chaos with 5:1 lighting ratio; cold top light casting fractured shadows, museum-exhibit stillness. Abstract office ruin — a deconstructed cubicle built from concrete slabs, scattered fluorescent light tubes on the floor, suspended ceiling panel floating mid-air. Androgynous Vietnamese model in her 30s, standing on one leg atop a broken desk, spine arched backwards unnaturally, tie draped over face, briefcase hanging from elbow, eyes closed. 1 hero item (deconstructed gray power suit jacket with asymmetric hem)  2 supporting pieces (crumpled red silk tie, pinstripe trousers with raw edge) — arranged in reverse-pyramid composition. Upside-down office chair bolted to wall, wall clock with melted face à la Dalí, floating copier paper caught in motion at 1/1000s. Shape: One-shouldered tailored blazer with exploded inner structure. Material: Stiff wool suiting fabric fused with resin panels. Key Feature: Fold-out lapel resembling architectural wings.",
