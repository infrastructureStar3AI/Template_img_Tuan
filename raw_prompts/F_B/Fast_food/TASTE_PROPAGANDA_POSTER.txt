- Other hand clenched at his chest, in salute or pledge pose  
- Head turned slightly upward with intense expression — eyes glowing with purpose

[Product Placement]:  
- **Fried chicken drumstick** enlarged, detailed texture: crispy uneven coating, visible seasoning flakes, slightly oily shine  
- Logo of the fictional republic engraved onto the crust of the drumstick  
- A tray of golden fries resting at soldier's feet, with a soda cup tipped over, releasing cola in form of a national banner
