[Overall Atmosphere]
Wide cinematic shot. Dusk lighting. The entire scene is a surreal landscape where a giant transparent cocktail bottle is embedded into a glowing canyon.
From its tilted mouth, a luminous stream of sparkling orange liquid flows like a glowing river, snaking across the land.
Atmosphere is magical, still, and warm. Viewpoint: ¾ aerial, looking down at an angle from top-right.
