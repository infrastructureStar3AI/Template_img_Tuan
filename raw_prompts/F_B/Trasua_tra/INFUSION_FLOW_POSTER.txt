[Overall Atmosphere]:
Vertical infographic poster in flat 2D vector illustration style. Warm, intelligent, and health-driven mood. Stylized matcha swirl flows from the cup, shaped like an upward ribbon path. A3 layout (portrait). Background is gradient matte green, with subtle circular dot overlays and faint leaf vein motifs. All text and visuals are clean, outlined, and proportionally spaced. Energetic but composed.

[Dominant Color]:
Main: Matcha Green (#6A8D59, 60%)
Accent: Pale Pistachio (#DCEFC7, 20%)

[General Environment]:
No physical setting. The entire background is a soft gradient (deep green to mossy lime) with radial dot textures. From the cup at the bottom-center, a smooth matcha stream swirls upward in an S-shaped path, carrying illustrated ingredients and embedded infographic bubbles. Side zones are used for labels, benefits, charts, and data.

[Model Pose]:
None. The matcha swirl is the main subject. The flow itself becomes the visual character.
