[Overall Atmosphere]:
Energetic suspension with elegant chaos, mid-air stillness captured at the moment of impact; 4:1 lighting ratio with bright overhead light and soft back fill, creating dynamic texture and clarity in the splash form. Advertisement energy meets product purity.

[Dominant Color]:
Main: Ceremonial Matcha Green (#7CA178, 55%)
Accent: Milk Foam White (#F6F4F2, 25%)

[General Environment]:
Mid-air product environment — the cup floats above ground against a soft bamboo-beige gradient background with subtle Japanese washi texture. No table or ground is visible. Surrounding air is clean, with light vapor trails emphasizing motion and freshness.

[Model Pose]:
(No model — replaced by liquid behavior.) Transparent plastic matcha latte cup tilts 45° while floating in mid-air. From the upper-left, creamy milk pours into the drink, captured at the moment it crashes and splashes outward in a crown-shaped burst. Ice cubes are ejected mid-splash, spinning freely.

[Product Placement]:
1 hero item (floating iced matcha latte cup, tilted diagonally, splash rising from impact point)
2 supporting pieces (hovering bamboo whisk near base, spiraling matcha leaf fragments caught in the air) — arranged with dynamic motion around the splash arc.

[Detailed Product Description]:
Shape: Tall transparent cup with slight taper, angled mid-air.
Material: PET plastic cup with clear layering of bright green matcha, milk, and visible ice.
Key Feature: Milk splash forms elegant, curved crown structure suspended mid-air, with droplets trailing behind.

[Supporting Elements]:
Three semi-transparent ice cubes with motion trails; bamboo whisk floating near bottom-left; tiny suspended matcha powder particles; soft vapor rings enhancing spatial depth.

[Logo Placement]:
Printed logo near top rim of cup, angled to match tilt; small serif text beneath: “Uji Matcha Quality” in white-on-clear ink, subtle and integrated.

[Advertising Integration]:
Main Text: “ELEVATE YOUR BALANCE” — stylized sans-serif, arching above the splash shape
CTA: “Try the Float Series →” — bottom-left, matcha green, thin modern serif, semi-transparent

[Image Type]:
High-resolution creative commercial product shot. Studio lighting with multi-point soft highlights, sharp freeze-frame splash at 1/8000s simulation, realistic shadows and volumetric lighting, slight motion blur on topping elements to simulate impact.

[Negative Prompt]:
No hands, no floor or table, no dirty splash, no low-quality textures, no surreal liquids, no flat backgrounds, no pastel filters, no cluttered elements.
