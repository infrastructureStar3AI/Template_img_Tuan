  "prompt_base": "Rustic calm in a forest morning — dappled sunlight filters through autumn leaves, with soft beams scattering across an uneven woodland table. The mood is organic and romantic, like a secret meal shared in the woods after dawn. A handcrafted wooden picnic table sits under a canopy of amber-orange foliage. Fallen leaves scatter naturally across the tabletop. The tableware is mismatched ceramic and vintage silver, giving it a nostalgic, earthy tone. Mushrooms grow beside the table legs, and tiny birds perch nearby. (No human model visible.) Only a shadow of a person’s arm is seen from the side, pouring warm cider from a glass kettle into a fogged mug. Steam gently rises, catching the sunlight. 1 hero item: A stacked savory-sweet toast tower with roasted figs, brie, toasted walnuts, and honey drizzle  2 supporting dishes: A stoneware bowl of pear compote and a folded linen napkin with gold flatware Mushrooms, chestnuts, and acorns casually placed around the scene  A foggy glass of cider with clove and orange peel inside  Faint glimmers of morning dew on the wood surface and ceramic glaze Shape: Irregular toast layers, rustic and hearty, stacked like forest bark  Material: Dense country loaf with grill marks, creamy melted cheese, glistening fig slices  Key Feature: Honey dripping from a wooden honey dipper, suspended in motion between fig and toast",
