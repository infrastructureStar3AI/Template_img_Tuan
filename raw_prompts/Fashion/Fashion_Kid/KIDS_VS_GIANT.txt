[Overall Atmosphere]
Playful and cinematic — the child is inside a gigantic version of a modern living room. The floor is a textured rug with LEGO-sized fibers. A pair of adult sneakers (size 45) stands like buildings next to him. Soft afternoon sunlight enters from a high, out-of-frame window, casting long shadows.

[General Environment]
The “sneaker street” runs between two giant shoes. In the background: a tipped-over soda can the size of a trash bin. A LEGO brick acts as a bench. A coiled phone cable snakes across the floor like a rope. A sock hangs from a chair leg like a tarp. The child appears like a tiny explorer in an urban canyon made of house items.

[Model Pose]
Child stands confidently with one foot resting on a coaster (used like a pedestal), hands in hoodie pockets, head tilted slightly with a grin. Hoodie bunched slightly at waist, sleeves pushed up. Lighting highlights fabric texture.
