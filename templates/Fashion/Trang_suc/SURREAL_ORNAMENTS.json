Infinite staircase loops upon itself mid-air, Escher-style. The ring rests on a single hovering marble tile — which spins gently in place without support. Purple light leaks from invisible seams in space. None. The product is central, floating. However, a marble hand reaches out from a fold in reality, trying to grasp it — frozen mid-motion. 1 hero item: Amethyst-cut ring in twisted silver band  Shadow ring echo appears behind, delayed by 0.5s • Soft echo blur behind gemstone • Grid fracture under ring’s floating tile • Small tag reads “<TIME: FOLDED>” engraved on edge • Reflected silhouette shows a different version of the ring (glitch artifact) Shape: Spiral double-band with pronged gemstone mount Material: Rhodium-plated silver + precision-cut amethyst (oval 1.4ct) Key Feature: Asymmetrical tension setting — stone appears suspended in magnetic pressure",
