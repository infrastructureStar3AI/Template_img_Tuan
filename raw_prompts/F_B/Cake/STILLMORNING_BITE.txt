[Overall Atmosphere]:
Rustic calm in a forest morning — dappled sunlight filters through autumn leaves, with soft beams scattering across an uneven woodland table. The mood is organic and romantic, like a secret meal shared in the woods after dawn.

[General Environment]:
A handcrafted wooden picnic table sits under a canopy of amber-orange foliage. Fallen leaves scatter naturally across the tabletop. The tableware is mismatched ceramic and vintage silver, giving it a nostalgic, earthy tone. Mushrooms grow beside the table legs, and tiny birds perch nearby.

[Model Pose]:
(No human model visible.) Only a shadow of a person’s arm is seen from the side, pouring warm cider from a glass kettle into a fogged mug. Steam gently rises, catching the sunlight.
